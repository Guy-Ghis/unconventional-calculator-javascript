# Unconventional-Calculator-Javascript
---
## Overview
Unconventional Calculator isn't your average calculator. It performs basic arithmetic operations while keeping track of what it just did — using the result of the previous calculation as the starting point for the next. Plus, it provides a human-readable description of each operation, making it easier to follow your mathematical journey.

Think of it as chaining calculations with a side of clarity.
